	  <p>The creation of a new university is an exciting challenge and presents an opportunity to build upon the excellent contribution that those institutions made to the nation over three centuries.</p>
      <p>We are proud of our heritage but we also look to our future by creating a radical new model for education linking to further education colleges and schools to create greater opportunities for participation and access across south-west Wales.</p>
      <p>The University has secured a multimillion pound government investment which is being reinvested to provide an environment befitting twenty-first century learning, teaching and scholarship.</p>
      <p>Both of our campuses, Carmarthen and Lampeter, offer an enriching environment with everything that our students need for their academic and personal development.</p>
      <p>We also offer a range of programmes for students who study at our partner institutions and make every effort to ensure the quality of the experience for all of our students.</p>
      <p>We acknowledge that you are making a considerable investment in your future. It is a decision that we take seriously, and will make every effort to ensure that your experience as a student here will help you to develop your potential to the full.</p>
      <p> We will provide you with sound academic knowledge, but we also believe that the rich diversity of cultural and social experiences you will have as a student here will help you to develop a range of personal and professional qualities - these are both equally important considerations when choosing a university or college.</p>
      <p>I look forward to welcoming you if you do decide to become a student at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.</p>

      <p>The BA Film and Visual Culture is an innovative degree programme, which combines the academic study of film and other visual media with the creative production of individual pieces of work in specialised areas. By combining theory and practice, students are encouraged to enhance their understanding of cinema as a medium through the creation of practical work.</p>
      <p>The programme has been conceived with an emphasis upon vocational skills and employability; over the course of their studies, students will assemble a portfolio of work to enable them to compete for employment in their chosen field of the film industry.</p>
      <p>Emphasis has been given to entrepreneurial skills, and to the skills required to publish and exhibit work to audiences beyond the university.</p>
	  <p>Students will be invited to engage with a broad range of contemporary media (such as film, television, graphic novels and comics, internet and mobile publishing, interactive media and gaming), and to focus their major projects upon the areas of their choice.</p>
	  <p>Over the course of the programme, students will be able to combine the theoretical and academic analysis of film and visual media, with practical and creative approaches. Students will have the opportunity to engage in all stages of filmmaking, from conception, through pre-production and production, and on to publication and/or exhibition.</p>
	  <p>Over the course of these processes, students will gain an insight into those areas that they would wish to specialise in. By their final year, students will be able to opt for a major creative project in a production area of their choice; this could take the form of screenwriting, filmmaking, animation or game design, to name some of the options open to students.</p>

		<h1>Art and Design: Multidisciplinary</h1>
	</div>
	<div data-role="content">
	  <p>The College has an established reputation for facilitating the creative development of art and design students. This course was developed in response to students who may wish to continue to study in more than one art/design/craft discipline over the three years of their degree programme. The course offers you a broad-based experience of contemporary visual and material arts practice and allows you to negotiate and develop a more personalised programme of study within speColeg Sir Gart areas of art and design to suit your own particular interests and needs (subject to timetabling requirements). </p>
	  <p>From the onset of the course you will have opportunities to gain experiences from a range of disciplines within the Applied Arts, Design and Fine Art programmes. Your chosen areas of study may combine electives from within the individual disciplines in order to facilitate practice that seeks to continue to work in more than one discrete area. Many Post-graduate teacher training courses (PGCE) expect prospective students to have experience across a range of art and design activities in addition to their own speColeg Sir Gart area. Students will develop a knowledge and understanding of exciting developments within international contemporary art, applied arts and design, its contexts and markets. Professional practice and enterprise skills teaching will help prepare students for employment and self employment options. </p>
	  <p>Your practice is supported by an integrated theory programme enabling you to work confidently and professionally within the context of Multidisciplinary Art and Design. The School of Creative Arts provides a friendly and supportive environment for students to explore their options and develop their individual style and potential</p>

	  <p>Coleg Sir Gar - Carmarthenshire College has an established reputation for facilitating the creative development of art and design students. This new course has evolved in response to contemporary art and design practice, culture and industry and is available bilingually, where students can choose to be taught and supported through the medium of Welsh or English. </p>
	  <p>On this course, students will be encouraged to explore traditional and digital illustrative techniques. Students will be working in 2D, 2.5D and 3D environments using speColeg Sir Gart software to develop the ability to combine 2D painting techniques with 3D sculpting and create illustrations that blend the two. This will enable students to expand the barriers of experimentation and creativity. Experimentation is seen as paramount in achieving this, and a keen interest in the visual world should inform this experimentation. There is a strong emphasis on drawing as a means of exploring the visual environment. Aimed at students with a keen interest in drawing and an interest in digital imaging, this course focuses on understanding and developing visual language and refining technique. </p>
	  <p>Through experimentation, exploration and continual practice you are encouraged to develop your individual style, methods and language as diverse as your imagination. Areas covered would include life drawing, concept art development, 2D, 2.5D and 3-D illustration, including modelling, texturing, lighting and rendering. Alongside the core practical skills, students also learn enriching conceptual and theoretical topics such as art, design and communication.</p>
	  <p>You will develop a speColeg Sir Gart range of skills and be challenged by industry level assignments and internationally set competition briefs. To use illustration in a wide range of media such as video games, films, animation, advertising and publishing. There is a growing demand for digital artists/illustrator and graphic designers who have exposure to both 3D design and digital illustration. Graduates from this course should certainly have the right skills to help meet that demand. </p>
	  <p>The programme can also offer individuals an opportunity to create work in a bilingual context and environment. Your practice is supported by an integrated theory programme enabling students to work confidently and professionally within the context of 2D and 3D Illustration. </p>
