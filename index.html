	<div data-role="content">
	  <p>The creation of a new university is an exciting challenge and presents an opportunity to build upon the excellent contribution that those institutions made to the nation over three centuries.<img src="http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/theuniversity/medwin_hughes.jpg" alt="Dr Medwin Hughes" title="Dr Medwin Hughes" align="right"></p>
      <p>We are proud of our heritage but we also look to our future by creating a radical new model for education linking to further education colleges and schools to create greater opportunities for participation and access across south-west Wales.</p>
      <p>The University has secured a multimillion pound government investment which is being reinvested to provide an environment befitting twenty-first century learning, teaching and scholarship.</p>
      <p>Both of our campuses, Carmarthen and Lampeter, offer an enriching environment with everything that our students need for their academic and personal development.</p>
      <p>We also offer a range of programmes for students who study at our partner institutions and make every effort to ensure the quality of the experience for all of our students.<img src="http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/theuniversity/coat_of_arms.jpg" alt="TSD Coat of arms" title="TSD Coat of arms" align="left"></p>
      <p>We acknowledge that you are making a considerable investment in your future. It is a decision that we take seriously, and will make every effort to ensure that your experience as a student here will help you to develop your potential to the full.</p>
      <p> We will provide you with sound academic knowledge, but we also believe that the rich diversity of cultural and social experiences you will have as a student here will help you to develop a range of personal and professional qualities - these are both equally important considerations when choosing a university or college.</p>
      <p>I look forward to welcoming you if you do decide to become a student at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.</p>

      <p><strong>Lampeter is a lively, historic market town set at the foothills of the Cambrian Mountains in the county of Ceredigion.</strong></p>
  
      <p>Our campus is situated in the middle of town and hence all shops and   amenities are located within easy walking distance. Lampeter offers a   variety of unusual, independent shops, together with student-friendly   caf√©s and pubs that provide everything you need on a day to day basis.</p>
      <p>The town is a centre for organic food with a wide selection of   organic fruits, vegetables, cheeses, breads, and other quality   foodstuffs for sale or served in local restaurants.</p>

      <p>The campus was founded in 1822 as St David&rsquo;s College to provide a   liberal education to members of the clergy including Classics and   History amongst other disciplines.</p>
      <p>Over the years it developed the range of subjects and, as the   University of Wales Lampeter, enjoyed a reputation for undergraduate and   postgraduate provision in English, Archaeology, Chinese, Classics,   History, Theology, as well as such new areas as Philosophy,   Anthropology, Ancient Civilisations and Creative Writting.</p>
      <p>A new development is the introduction of Education modules to form   Major/Minor and Combined Honours programmes. Now, as the University of   Wales Trinity Saint David, the academic community continues to thrive   and the portfolio offered attracts an international cohort of students   each year.</p>
      <p>The campus is situated on one of the town&rsquo;s main thoroughfares. The   original building stands proudly against the lush green hills of rural   Wales and a stream ambles its way around the campus perimeter. The   riverbanks on campus are a designated Site of Special Scientific   Interest due to the number of indigenous wildlife habitats it maintains   including water voles and otters.</p>
    <p>The campus facilities boast one of the best libraries and private   collections of medieval manuscripts in the country - The Roderic Bowen   Library and Archives - as well as the Canterbury Building which is home   to the range of services providing support for our students. The Arts   Hall and Cliff Tucker Theatre are both modern and well-equipped venues   used for lectures as well as arts and community events.</p>
    <p>The University&rsquo;s sports facilities have also been enhanced and   include joint provision between the University and Ceredigion County   Council. In addition, student accommodation across the campus has been   upgraded.	</p>

	  <p><strong>The new generation of opera singers face a¬† faster, more demanding commercial profession than in the past.</strong></p>
      <p><img src="http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/academies/wiav/treble_cleff_blue_300-200x286.jpg" alt="Treble Cleff" width="210" height="346" title="Treble Cleff" align="left">  <img src="http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/academies/wiav/wiav_girl_green_dress.jpg" alt="WIAV" width="210" height="346" title="WIAV" align="right"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Operatic excellence was traditionally a career-long goal gradually   achieved through experience in the profession, with vocal security and   techniques needed to sustain long careers.¬† In today&rsquo;s more &lsquo;instant&rsquo;   world with new dramatic expectations and requirements, artists are often   cast in the most exacting roles at an earlier stage and are under   pressure to succeed more quickly.</p>
      <p>This reduces the opportunities to patiently refine talent and to   carefully prepare for careers that hopefully will be long but   demanding.¬† Recognising the many excellent instituations offering expert   dramatic tuition, WIAV&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;etre is the providion of intense   study concentrating on stylistic issues and advanced vocal technique¬† It   is a centre of excellence, an opportunity to prepare for the challenge   of an extremely exacting and unforgiving world stage.</p>
      <p>The Academy is not an opera studio in the conventional sense. Our   approach to the dramatic goal is unusual yet traditional. The underlying   ethos is the provision of a solid technique with linguistic and   stylistic understanding, the basis of security in the early and most   dangerous years of an operatic career.</p>
      <h1>The vision and future of WIAV      </h1>
      <p><strong><em>Recognising his earlier success in the field, the newly   formed University of Wales Trinity Saint David, invited Dennis O&rsquo;Neill   to establish an International Academy of Voice, a centre of vocal   excellence and to locate it in Wales, an ideal environment justly famous   as &lsquo;the land of song&rsquo; the starting point for so many internationally   successful singers.</em></strong></p>
      <p>WIAV provides a highly specialised and unique environment for a small   number of exceptional singers at the early-professional stage, selected   and recruited globally, to develop and polish their talent to the   highest professional standards.</p>
      <p>The best coaches, language experts and vocal technicians are   complemented by visiting eminent conductors and national and   international stars from the Operatic world.</p>
      <p>The Academy will provide a world-class institution within one of the   UK&rsquo;s leading centres of higher education and an opportunity to lead in a   field in which Wales is historically pre-eminent and globally admired.</p>
      <p>The Academy will create international alumni ambassadors, promoting   the University&rsquo;s reputation and its commitment to international excellence.</p>

	  <p><strong>By virtue of its limited student intake the Academy is</strong> <strong>able to operate an intense and personalised programme.¬†</strong></p>
      <p>Most students will have already succeeded at other Universities and   Conservatoires and possibly have some professional experience. WIAV   seeks to complement those experiences with a programme of demanding   study at a professional level.</p>
      <p><img src="http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/academies/wiav/wiav_concert.jpg" alt="WIAV Concert" width="464" height="127" title="WIAV Concert"></p>
      <p>There are thirty weeks of study and performance over two semesters,   with three week breaks at Christmas and Easter. Students will be   enrolled at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.</p>
      <p>The emphasis is on critical musical and vocal aspects of performance.   The dramatic elements of performance are also studied ,particularly in   preparation of our public performances through regular group sessions in   the Stanislawski method. This work will form the basis of all staged or   semi staged performances.</p>
      <p>Students receive regular one to one tuition,in Vocal Technique, Art   Song,Concert repertoire, Languages and Operatic repertoire central to   their careers. They will be required to master and memorise two new   Operatic roles in the original language. There are also group events in   audition technique and preparation,, recitative classes and ensemble   work. Importance is given to developing a thorough knowledge of   repertoire and of concert and recital material and the research and   selection of the same, to develop self reliance and self awareness with   artistic confidence.</p>
      <p>The Director leads the vocal ¬†technique team giving regular   individual lessons. Our coaches and repetiteurs with whom each student   will learn their repertoire, are drawn from the leading companies of the   UK and we also bring in specialist coaches from other parts of the   world. ¬†All our language coaches are from international opera houses and   teach the method of idiomatic delivery of text in a singing legato   line.</p>
      <p>Of great importance is the system of regular masterclass days given   by national and international celebrities, These give an opportunity of   working at a professional level and the opportunity to reflect on the   work of fellow students encouraging understanding and a critical ear. In   addition, distinguished lecturers will visit in related subjects such   as the physiology of singing, performance styles in different eras, etc.</p>
      <p>An additional unique teaching method is our one to one weekly   sessions studying historical peer performance, relevant to the student&rsquo;s   repertoire and study, through the medium of historical recordings both   in sound and on video. The Academy has an enormous collection of this   material at its disposal.</p>
      <p>The University has a very successful performing Arts reputation with   several important courses and excellent facilities. The Academy will   work closely with these programmes as an active part of the Faculty of   Arts and Humanities.</p>
      <p>These performance facilities will be available to the Academy, along   with other local facilities and venues for public performance.¬†Many of   the performances will take place at the University&rsquo;s campuses in   Carmarthen and Lampeter, and occasionally in Cardiff where the Academy   is based. Our method provides the students with the same preparation for   performance as professionals receive.¬†</p>
      <p>The Academy recognises that the best teacher is the stage itself and   our many activities involve several weeks of pure performance.¬† These   will involve staged or partially staged scenes from Opera, when   programming is constructed around the voices of the group and not voice   category, enabling all singers as equal an opportunity to perform as   possible.</p>
      <p>Other performances will include Sacred works, Opera Galas and   recitals of Art Song. Performances will be frequent and used to assess   progress and standards Whenever practical, performances will be open to   the public.

	  <p>The Higher Education Academy defines employability as a &lsquo;sets of   achievements - skills, understandings and personal attributes - that   make graduates more likely<img src="http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/marketing/TSD_plus_english_infographic.jpg" alt="TSD+" height="270" title="TSD+" align="right"> to gain employment and be successful in their   chosen occupations, which benefits themselves, the workforce, the   community and the economy&rsquo; (2012). Employability skills are now   generally recognised as essential underpinning skills for the workplace.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Trinity Saint David has already embedded employability as a key   feature of its academic provision but the University has also launched a   new awards scheme as an additional opportunity for students to engage   in activities that will allow them to further develop a wide range of   employability skills.</p>
      <p>The TSD+ Award has been designed to supplement your degree programme   and provide additional opportunities for you to build up your   employability skills in a systematic way during your period of study. We   want to see you taking part in a range of activities on campus and in   the community to enable you to further develop key transferable skills   that you will come across during your academic studies.</p>
      <p>These skills will be logged in a Skills Passport which you will be   able to show to future employers. You can build up your skills by   becoming a course representative, a student ambassador, working in the   Students&rsquo; Union or volunteering with a community group amongst a whole   range of activities that may interest you.</p>
      <p>This particular award can be used to support your Personal   Development Plan (PDP) and will demonstrate to potential employers that   you have achieved the knowledge and experience needed to make a positive   contribution to their workplace.  </p>

  <div data-role="content">
	  
    <p>Studying at University is exciting, but it can also feel stressful   and difficult at times, so it is important to look after yourself. If   you are healthy, you¬†will be able to make the most of your course and   the¬†opportunities that student life has to offer.</p>
    <p>If you begin to struggle with relationships or find that you cannot   cope with your coursework, there may be reasons for this. There   is¬†support available to help you identify what is causing problems and   to put sustainable support in place. All the services are free and   confidential and provided by experienced qualified specialist   professionals.</p>
    <p>Our health continually changes, being affected by everything that is happening around us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether we are eating and sleeping properly</li>
      <li>Whether we are getting on with our family and friends</li>
      <li>Whether we are keeping in¬†touch with our friends and loved ones</li>
      <li>How we are feeling or how our friends and family are feeling</li>
      <li>Whether we are keeping active and exercising enough</li>
      <li>Whether we feel able to ask for help when we need to</li>
      <li>Whether we are taking regular breaks and maintaining a healthy balance in our lives</li>
      <li>Whether we are taking care of our sexual health</li>
      <li>Whether we are looking after our safety</li>
      <li>Whether we maintain our hobbies and are able to relax and enjoy ourselves</li>
      <li>Whether or not we are doing things that we feel good at which maintain our self esteem</li>
      <li>Whether we accept who we are as individuals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are five simple ways to help you in maintaining a balanced lifestyle:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Don't ignore any problems that are worrying you. Don't underestimate   the benefits of sharing any worries you may have. It helps to talk</li>
      <li>Be aware of what and when you are eating and drinking. A healthy   diet and lots of water maintain your physical and mental wellbeing. This   is the fuel that keeps you on the road</li>
      <li>Aim to keep your sleep pattern regular, between 6 to 8 hours will   keep concentration at optimum levels, help you manage your emotions and   sense of perspective</li>
      <li>You are drinking too much alcohol if it affects your work, your   relationships, your finances or your health. More information is   available at <a href="http://www.downyourdrink.org.uk">www.downyourdrink.org.uk</a></li>
      <li>20 minutes of exercise daily improves physical health and helps   maintain stress levels. Free swimming is provided on the Carmarthen   campus and¬†at the local swimming pool in Lampeter, and gym facilities   are also available</li>

	  <h2>      Disability - Additional Needs Support</h2>
      <p>We aim to provide students who require support with the tools to   enable them to work to their potential and demonstrate the true level of   their abilities as an undergraduate or postgraduate student. It is   hoped, too, that they will benefit from their experience with Learning   Support at the University in such a way that they will be enriched with   skills, strategies and improved levels of self-confidence that will also   serve them for the rest of their adult lives.<br>
        <br>
        Your first point   of contact is likely to be the Disability Administrator. Students may   request an interview to discuss their needs or concerns at any point   during their course. More information about Learning Support can be   accessed via the links below:</p>

    <h2>Confidentiality and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We provide a mediated learning environment that demonstrates respect   for both student and staff and empowers those involved in the learning   process. This reflects the legal environment, where consultation is   encouraged and involvement of the users is regarded as essential.<br>
        <br>
        All   material regarding additional needs is regarded as confidential until   the student signs a declaration granting disclosure, for instance to   lecturers, support staff or examiners.<br>
        <br>
        There is an Individual   Learning Contract to set levels of mutual expectation and which is   discussed between the student and their support staff, then signed by   each participant. This is reviewed at specific times during the year.    </p>

		<h1>Who Do We Support</h1>
	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
	  <h3>
      <p>Our goal is to give all students, including those with disabilities,   equal opportunities to encounter our wide range of academic, social and   cultural experiences. We try - with reasonable adjustment - to meet   needs and overcome difficulties, so that these no longer present any   barrier to potential and existing students.<br>
        <br>
        We welcome   applications from students with additional needs. A declaration of   disability will in no way disadvantage you in the application procedure.   Students with a declared disability are encouraged to visit before   applying to see what facilities are available. DSA Administrators and   the Senior Learning Support Coordinator are available to discuss   individual needs, in particular any specific arrangements needed for   access, learning support, study support, lectures, placements,   assessments and examinations.<br>
        <br>
      Many of you will already have   received some support for your studies, either in school or college, and   found that support helped you to achieve good results. Many of our   students at Trinity Saint David also benefit from support with their   studies. If you know already that there is a particular reason why you   will need support, it is best to get in touch with the DSA   Administrator.¬†      </h3>
	  <h2>Physical Disability</h2>
      <p>We aim to help those with a physical disability; we understand the   issues that students may have which others take for granted, for   instance, with access to toilets, cafes, the library and lecture rooms   and campuses have been designed with this in mind. We also recognise   that students may have difficulties with managing assignments, seminars   and examinations and special consideration is taken of these aspects of   your study.</p>
      <h2>Visual Impairment</h2>
      <p>If you suffer from any form of visual impairment, the University has access to the services available at Swansea University's¬†<a href="http://www.swan.ac.uk/iss/libraries/sutc/" title="Transcription centre">Transcription Centre</a>.¬†The   Transcription Centre is able to provide visually impaired students with   texts in their preferred format including audio, Braille, large print,   tactile or electronic format.</p>
    <h2>Hidden Disabilities</h2>
      <p>We encourage students with hidden disabilities, such as epilepsy,   diabetes, ME, Specific Learning Differences etc. to discuss their needs   with the DSA Administrator. Hidden disabilities are often as   debilitating as more obvious disabilities. We are here to discuss   difficulties and to find solutions.¬†<br>
        <br>
        If you have a long term¬†<strong>mental health</strong>¬†problem,   the everyday struggles of being a student can seem more difficult. You   may feel isolated or your work may feel it is getting on top of you. You   may not be sure what is expected of you or how to organise your time   effectively. This is why we have a mentoring service for students with   mental health problems co-ordinated by our Mental Health Advisor.   Mentoring is organised through the¬†Student Services¬†office and involves   meeting a mentor on a regular basis to talk about how you're managing as   a student.<br>
        <br>
        Mentoring is not counselling but it will offer you   the support you need while you're at university. The mentor who sees you   will help you to manage your workload, work out strategies to deal with   your studies more effectively, find your way around the university   systems and offer regular support.<br>
        <br>

Follow this link for more   information and how you can access support and self-help materials.</p>
      <h2>What are Specific Learning Differences (SpLD)?</h2>
    <p>Sometimes known as neurodiversity or Specific Learning Difficulties,   Specific Learning Differences include Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, ADHD, and   Asperger's Syndrome amongst others. These conditions are known as   specific processing differences - a mixture of strengths and weaknesses.   Indicators include difficulties with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organisation and planning, e.g. time management, thinking</li>
        <li>Memory</li>
        <li>Expressing ideas orally and/or in writing</li>
        <li>Social communication</li>
        <li>Reading: speed, accuracy, comprehension</li>
        <li>Spelling</li>
        <li>Handwriting</li>
        <li>Note-taking</li>

      <p>The¬†University of Wales Trinity Saint David¬†welcomes applications   from students with dyslexia and other Specific Learning Difficulties. We   can make arrangements for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing information for potential and present students</li>
        <li>Initial screening</li>
        <li>Assessment</li>
        <li>Access to the DSA</li>
        <li>Early and appropriate tutorial support</li>
        <li>Advocacy with University staff</li>
        <li>Concessions where necessary</li>
        <li>Greater accessibility to University facilities e.g. extended library loans</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>If you have already been assessed as dyslexic or have another Specific Learning Difficulty,</strong> we advise that you take the following steps before the start of your   university course in order to avoid unnecessary delay in the provision   of your technical and tutorial support:</p>
      <p>Step 1. Check that your current assessment is less than 18 months   old. If it is older than that, ask your school or college to arrange an   update.</p>
      <p>Step 2. Contact your LEA to apply for the Disabled Students&rsquo;   Allowance (DSA) and ask them to arrange a Needs Assessment for you   before you start university.</p>
      <p>Step 3. Come to see us at the Study Support Centre in Student   Services or contact us by phone as soon as you make a definite decision   to come to¬†the University¬†or when you arrive at the start of your   course. Bring your Needs Assessment with you.</p>
      <p>We will then ensure that everything you need is put in place for you with the minimum of delay.</p>

	   <p>Lampeter can boast long sporting traditions as legend has it that a   member of St David&rsquo;s College staff brought rugby to <img src="http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/departments/sport/lampetercampus/sduc_v_uwic_rugby_match2009.jpg" alt="Lampeter v Uwic Rugby Match" title="Lampeter v Uwic Rugby Match" align="right">Wales and Lampeter   Town Rugby Football Club was one of the Founder members of the Welsh   Rugby Union in 1881.              
    <p>Rugby continues to be played here, but alongside a range of different   sports and activities, many of which would not even have been   recognised then.¬† Popular student sports include football, hockey,   fencing, archery, martial arts such as Jiu-Jitsu and Tae-Kwando, and   outwards bounds activities.</p>

       <p>Students have free access to the local swimming pool during student   sessions, or can use it as a member of the public at other times. In   addition, the modern leisure centre nearby provides a fitness suite and   sports hall where a wide range of organised classes and more informal   activities are offered.</p>
       <p>For less formal outdoor pursuits, students are spoilt for choice.   Within easy driving distance are the Brecon Beacons, Snowdonia and   Pembrokeshire National Parks, the last two with excellent climbing. On   the doorstep are the Cambrian Mountains (sometimes referred to as   Britain&rsquo;s &ldquo;forgotten National Park&rdquo;) with deeply cut wooded valleys and   gorges, interspersed with vast areas of unpopulated and stunning   moorland scenery. The mountains, along with the nearby coast of Cardigan   Bay, provide unrivalled opportunities for walking, canoeing, wind   sailing, surfing, caving, or simply getting away from it all. Other   popular past times include riding, mountain biking, and wildlife   watching.</p>

      <p>During your 3 years, you will explore multiple perspectives to   psychological issues, recognising that psychology involves a range of   research methods, theories, evidence and applications. You will explore   patterns in behaviour, both normal and abnormal,¬† psychological   functioning and experience through investigating the role of brain   function in all human behaviour and experience.</p>
      <p>There will be opportunities to carry out empirical studies involving a   variety of methods of data collection, including experiments,¬†   observation, psychometric tests, questionnaires, interviews and field   studies using current experimental software packages.</p>
      <p>The inclusive studies component of the programme will allow you to   engage with the principal features of social policy and inclusive¬†   strategies within organisations in both national and international   contexts. You will learn about the tensions that exist between the   reality and the ideal of inclusive policies; to acknowledge, accept and   understand the values and interests of others, by taking¬† account of   their normative and moral positions.</p>

		<h1>Social Inclusion</h1>
	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
	  <p>The Social Inclusion programmes are unique in that they embody social   theory, social policy and professional practice. Social Inclusion, now   recognised as a field in its own right, draws its body of theory from   social policy, sociology and psychology. However it is not just about   social policy and social theory. The principles of inclusive practice   are embedded into the programme. Through observational placements, you   will have the opportunity to gain insight into working with groups and   individuals, reflecting on your own values and that of the organisation   you are observing.</p>
      <p>Studying one of the Social Inclusion programmes will allow you to engage in current debate, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why do women dominate the caring professions?</li>
        <li>In the current economic climate, how can we continue to strengthen our communities and ensure they are sustainable?</li>
        <li>How can we provide inclusive and quality care for the elderly in an ageing population?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In response to the complex nature of this subject, three clear   pathways are offered to students. All degrees embody a sound grounding   in social inclusion explored through the interplay between social   theory, social policy and professional practice.¬† However the individual   degrees aim to reflect your career aspirations and enhance your   employability</p>
      <p>The new pathways within the programme will be:</p>
      <blockquote><strong>
      <h3>Additional Needs</h3></strong></blockquote>
      <p>This degree will focus on the broad range of groups and individuals   who may require additional support through the course of their life,   including mental health, additional learning needs and people in   challenging life situations, such as domestic violence or refugees.</p>
      <p>This programme will allow you to explore the policy and good   practices aimed at addressing these needs, and equip you with the skills   and knowledge to take up a career in a wide range of settings that   provide services for people with additional needs.</p>
      <blockquote><strong>
      <h3>Communities, Families and Individuals</h3></strong></blockquote>
      <p>This pathway will allow you to explore the relationship between   individuals, families and their communities, and the role these   relationships play in Social Policy, social justice and inclusion. The   pathway embraces the Welsh Government agenda about sustainable community   development, and how social exclusion is best challenged through   strengthening communities and families, and therefore will equip you   with knowledge and skills within an area that is of fundamental   political significance, looking at debates such as citizenship and human   rights. This pathway will enable you to work with individuals and   groups in a variety of voluntary and public sector services, social   enterprise or even private sector services.</p>
      <blockquote><strong>
        <h3>Health and Social Care</h3></strong></blockquote>
      <p>Health and Social Care remains an extremely popular choice for anyone   wishing to work with children and young people or adults, either as   professional social workers or the many opportunities that occur within   the NHS, National and Local Government.</p>
      <p>This pathway will give you the opportunity to explore issues central   to the provision of health and social care in a changing world. You will   engage in current debates, such as the challenges of providing care in   to an ageing population, debates of increasing concern to policy-makers   and providers.<strong></strong></p>
      <blockquote><strong><h3>Communities Families and Individuals
      </h3></strong></blockquote>
      <p>This degree will allow you to explore the relationship between   individuals, families and their communities, and the role these   relationships play in social policy, social justice and inclusion.

	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
	  <p>This degree scheme enables you to study the broad disciplines that   make up both Archaeology and Ancient History. You will have the   opportunity to study the material remains of ancient cultures and   participate in excavations.</p>
      <p>You will study the historical and literary documents along with the   material remains of ancient and classical sites and their associated   artefacts. The Archaeology part of the degree includes the study of the   human past through an examination of physical remains such as stone   tools, pottery and bones, through to buildings, structures, monuments   and landscapes, while the Ancient History part widens the types of   sources you will be studying by including textual and iconographic   evidence.<img src="http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/departments/facultyofhumanities/schoolarchaeologyhistoryanthropology/Athens_%7EDay1_025_opt-300x199.jpg" alt="Hephaistion, Athens" title="Hephaistion, Athens" align="right"></p>
    <p>This degree also offers you a number of field trips both within the   UK and abroad and at the core of this degree is an intensive field visit   to the Mediterranean region: currently, students visit Naples. Expert   guidance on these trips will be given by members of staff from the   Archaeology and Classics departments. Further work on the region is   undertaken back in Lampeter, where you have the opportunity to further   your knowledge of the archaeology and history of the Mediterranean.</p>

		<h1>Anthropology</h1>
	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
	  <p>Anthropology is one of the most dynamic and challenging disciplines   in the humanities because it takes the whole world as its point of   interest and brings you face to face with an eye-opening diversity of   behaviour whilst simultaneously asking you to question your own ideas   and assumptions.</p>
      <h2>About the BA Anthropology Course</h2>
      <p><img src="http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/courses/undergraduatecourses/anthropology_montage-500x142.jpg" alt="Anthropology Montage" width="430" title="Anthropology Montage"></p>
      <h3><strong>Anthropology is the study of human societies and cultures in all their richness and diversity.</strong></h3>
      <p>Anthropologists examine what it means to be human by exploring all   forms of social and cultural behaviour. They believe that to understand   humanity in depth the meanings embedded in human lives need to be   uncovered. Our students do this not by simply sitting in lectures   listening to how other anthropologists understand the world but by also   finding out how other people live and considering, in turn, what it is   like to live like them.</p>
    <p>Any aspect of cultural and social life is available for study in   Anthropology. We examine the daily and mundane as well as the rare and   &lsquo;exotic&rsquo;, the local alongside the global. What you might consider to be   very ordinary, obvious daily activities become complex areas of   investigation on inspection, and what might seem extraordinary, even   bizarre, transforms into something familiar, reasonable and explicable.</p>

		<h1>Archaeology</h1>
	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
	  <p>Archaeology is amongst one of the most active, varied and research   intensive academic Schools within the University. The School is based on   the cusp of the Cambrian mountains and thus enjoys being part of one of   the most beautiful University campus locations in the UK.</p>
      <p>The surrounding landscape, coastline and environment is also of a   uniquely historic and archaeological character which the School is able   to utilise in its teaching and research. This makes for a programme of   study that is highly practical, with plenty of on-site activity, that is   rooted in an exploration of regional examples and developments, and yet   is global in its points of reference.</p>
      <p>Archaeology is the study of the human past through an examination of   physical remains such as stone tools, pottery and bones, through to   buildings, structures, monuments and landscapes. It attempts to reveal   how both contemporary societies and past societies are organised, how   humanity interacts with the environments and landscapes, and how ideas   about the world are visible in the objects people have created.</p>
      <p>To be able to understand the past in any depth engagement with   theoretical and ethical issues is needed. This means we explore issues   such as heritage, representation, land use, technology, environmental   change, death, beliefs and the evolution of the human body, mind and   ideas with a view to broadening and widening knowledge of how humanity   has arrived at the position it is in now.</p>
    <p>Many modules include a field trip to local sites or historic features   of the landscape: we also do a graveyard survey for the less-squeamish.   As well as classroom activities you will participate on our annual   excavation at the spectacular Cistercian monastery and hinterland of   Strata Florida, a few miles north of the campus in the Cambrian   Mountains.</p>

      <p>Archaeology and Anthropology have previously been taught separately   at British universities, however, recent developments in theory and   method make this division look increasingly restrictive: Archaeology is   progressively more interested in ideas about society, whilst   anthropology today looks at the past as comfortably as it has looked at   the present.</p>
    <p>This degree scheme offers an exciting opportunity to take part in   this convergence between the two disciplines by offering specialised   courses devoted to exploring the synergies between them.</p>

  <div data-role="content">
	  <p>This degree scheme introduces students to History over a millennia,   from the &lsquo;invasion&rsquo; of 1066 all the way through to the Presidency of   Barack Obama.</p>
      <p><img src="http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/courses/undergraduatecourses/mansion.jpg" alt="Mansion" width="430" title="Mansion"></p>
      <p>It thus offers modules which cover broad sweeps of time (Medieval   Europe, 1066-1452: Modern China, 1650-2000) allowing students to   consider how societies alter and change, the long term impact of war,   economic upheaval and political radicalism, and the rise and fall of   great powers. In addition the programme offers modules based upon depth,   drilling down into events and moments of seminal change (the Great War,   Genocide in C20th, the Wars of the Roses, the Irish Question).</p>
      <p>This combination of breadth and depth provides students with an   extensive knowledge of the past. Around this core of subject knowledge   we root our teaching in documentary source materials, field trips,   visits to archives and record offices, in addition to the tutor&rsquo;s own   research experiences. This all provides for a fully rounded programme of   study which grounds students in the requisite methodologies and   practices of the discipline of history.</p>
      <p>In the first year, you will be introduced to new areas of study   through an examination of various historical case studies and   exploration of the historic environment, field trips and research   projects, and by investigating how the past is captured, made and   communicated through visits to archives or museums or analyses of film,   TV and other media. In the second and third years, you will deepen your   knowledge of the past through a combination of wide ranging modules,   that survey long periods of time, and more focused, topic-centred   specialist modules.</p>
    <p>This combination is extensive and covers all interests and   preferences from, for example, studies of modern America, the Wars of   the Roses, the troubles in Northern Ireland, and the Holocaust to   Post-War Britain.</p>

	  <p>The University can offer its students a broad range of History   programmes covering several millenia, from the Pharoahs of Ancient Egypt   through to the collapse of the Soviet Union, with an awful lot   in-between.<img src="http://www.ydrindoddewisant.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/departments/facultyofhumanities/schoolclassics/courses/01.jpg" alt="Alexander Sarcophagus, Sidon" title="Alexander Sarcophagus, Sidon" align="right"></p>
      <p>Our History provision spans different regions and continents of the   world,¬† and approaches the past in different ways, be that through the   lens of economics, politics, social formations, cultural constructions,   literary heritage, religious beliefs or material cultures. Whether your   own interest is to study across this broad range of periods, or whether   it is to focus upon your particular interest in the Ancient, Medieval,   Early Modern or Modern worlds, you will take a programme that combines   infinite fascination and relevance to the world around you, with the   acquisition of the right set of transferable skills with which to enter   the jobs market.</p>

    <p>If you want to know about the history of Ancient Greek and Roman   societies, then a degree in Ancient History is for you. The Ancient   History scheme allows you to study a wide range of modules covering not   only fascinating figures like Alexander the Great, but also basic   aspects of everyday life, such as warfare and the economy.</p>
      <p>In the first year, modules can be taken on a wide range of periods   and themes; in the second and third years, the School offers specialised   modules on all aspects of Greco-Roman history so that you can gain   in-depth knowledge in areas of particular interest to you. Options are   also available to study select modules in the wider Faculty of   Humanities, for example in Egyptology, Chinese History or Theology. The   culmination of the degree is the dissertation, where you are free to   pursue a topic of your choice in line with our range of research and   publication specialisms.      </p>
      <p>The School is proud of the wide range of assessment methods used on   the course, such as essays, presentations, wikis, web pages and   reflective reports, so that the assessment reflects the student&rsquo;s   performance as a whole. Students are also given the opportunity to   participate in the wider research community and are always welcome at   our monthly research seminar series, which feature speakers from around   the world. </p>
    <p>We are one of the largest Schools on campus but this does not mean   that you will get lost in the crowd - there is a strong sense of   community amongst our students and staff. The ratio of staff to students   means that we can offer an excellent student support network. Every   student has a personal tutor, and the School&rsquo;s dedicated Support Liaison   Officer and First Year Tutor are always on hand should extra support be   needed.</p>

      <p>This degree scheme enables you to study the broad disciplines that   make up both Archaeology and Ancient History. You will have the   opportunity to study the material remains of ancient cultures and   participate in excavations.</p>
    <p>You will study the historical and literary documents along with the   material remains of ancient and classical sites and their associated   artefacts. The Archaeology part of the degree includes the study of the   human past through an examination of physical remains such as stone   tools, pottery and bones, through to buildings, structures, monuments   and landscapes, while the Ancient History part widens the types of   sources you will be studying by including textual and iconographic   evidence.</p>
    <p>This degree also offers you a number of field trips both within the   UK and abroad and at the core of this degree is an intensive field visit   to the Mediterranean region: currently, students visit Naples. Expert   guidance on these trips will be given by members of staff from the   Archaeology and Classics departments. Further work on the region is   undertaken back in Lampeter, where you have the opportunity to further   your knowledge of the archaeology and history of the Mediterranean.</p>

  <div data-role="content">
	  <p>If you are interested in the ancient and medieval worlds, their   history, society and culture, then the BA in Ancient and Medieval   History is the degree for you.</p>
    <p>This degree offers a wide range of subjects from myth to knighthood   and from Homeric Greece to the end of the medieval period. It trains you   to use a variety of source materials from both periods, with   opportunities to learn how to use both ancient inscriptions and medieval   manuscripts.</p>

      <p>The   first year aims to provide the necessary basis of knowledge on the   history of the ancient and medieval worlds and an introduction to   ancient and medieval societies and cultures. In the second and third   years, you will have the opportunity to widen your studies into a   variety of different areas of interest from the Homeric world to the   Cistercians, and specialise in areas of your choice. Options are also   available to study selected modules in the wider Faculty of Humanities,   for example in Egyptology and medieval Literature.</p>
      <p>The culmination of the degree, and a module in which these   specialisms can especially be combined, is the dissertation, where you   are free to pursue a topic of your choice in line with our range of   research and publication specialisms. Students are also given the   opportunity to participate in the wider research community and are   always welcome at our monthly research seminar series, which feature   speakers from around the world.</p>
    <p>Based on the Lampeter campus, you will be taught by staff from the   School of Classics as well as from the School of Archaeology, History   and Anthropology, making sure that you always have expert support and   access to the latest research in the field. The school supports the very   active student-led Medieval Re-enactment and Ancient Civilisations   societies. Check out their facebook pages for more information.</p>

		<h1>Applied Philosophy</h1>
	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
	  <p>Philosophy is different from other academic disciplines in that it   teaches you not what to think, but how to think. Philosophy explores the   big questions ‚Äì Who are we? What is our place in the world? How should   we live? What is reality? Philosophy approaches such questions through   argument, but also through vision and imagination.</p>
      <p>A new degree that offers an opportunity to explore philosophical   approaches and questions as a prelude to their systematic application to   contemporary issues and debates.</p>
      <p>Applied philosophical studies involves questioning much that is taken   for granted by common sense or popular belief, in morals, politics,   religion, art, history and science. Consequently, its method is   necessarily both imaginative and analytic, the aim being to elucidate   concepts and understand varieties of explanation and description in   various fields, rather than to rival their proper practitioners in the   discovery of facts, the construction of theories or the implementation   of ideals. These debates include the values of freedom and equality,   human rights and social justice, and environmental ethics, asking   important questions such as whether punishment can be justified or   whether animals have rights?</p>
      <p>You will consider the significance of issues in metaphysics,   philosophy of mind, ethical theory and political philosophy to questions   of practical concern such as abortion, euthanasia, suicide, freedom of   speech, sexual and racial discrimination, debates surrounding   reproductive technologies, genetic enhancement, criminal punishment, the   environment, world hunger, and the welfare of future people.</p>

      <p>Philosophy is different from other academic disciplines in that it teaches you not what to think, but how to think.</p>
      <p>Philosophy explores the big questions - Who are we? What is our place   in the world? How should we live? What is reality? Philosophy   approaches such questions through argument, but also through vision and   imagination.</p>
      <p>Philosophy concerns every aspect of our lives, practical as well as   theoretical. Through its grounding in real social relations and human   activities, it seeks to understand and address the whole spectrum of   social, ethical, environmental and political issues of today. Through   Philosophy, we are able not only to understand life, but to shape it.</p>
      <p>If your interests extend to life, the universe and everything, if you   want to develop a rich set of life-enhancing skills and the power to   influence positive change, then our Philosophy degree is for you.</p>

      <p>Meeting the growing demand for provision at every level of the higher   education world, students can find a wealth of undergraduate courses,   postgraduate diplomas, certificates, MAs, MPhil and PhD opportunities in   a number of areas.¬†</p>
      <p>Single Honours BA degrees are offered in Theology, Religious Studies   and Crefydd a ChymdeithasÔªø.¬†¬†The BA Crefydd a Chymdeithas is the new   Welsh medium scheme, which offers students the possibility of doing   their whole course through the medium of Welsh. ¬†ÔªøThe School also offers   the Joint Honours degree¬†in¬†Islamic Studies¬†and Religious Studies,   which is a joint honours programme with Arabic as an optional component   of the course. ¬†¬†There are¬†many options for Joint Honours degrees, for   example in Theology and Philosophy and Religious Studies and   Anthropology.¬†¬† Numerous MA courses include World's Religions, Theology,   Islamic Studies, Religious Experience and more.

      <p>Our students become a part of an important historic tradition: we are   the first school of its kind in Wales and one of the oldest in the   United Kingdom. This rich heritage is reflected in the historic   buildings, the Founders' Library and the sense of beauty that surrounds   each of our campuses.¬† This is a school that is keen to pursue its   connection to the context of Wales and religious identities in Wales   whilst also reaching out to the world with expertise in religious   traditions that span the globe.</p>
    <p>Ninian Smart, one of the greatest modern authorities on the study of   religion and a regular visitor to the department once said, &ldquo;You cannot   do better in Britain in the field than here&rdquo;.¬† John Hick, Archbishop   Rowan Williams, Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, Professor Seyyed Hossein   Nasr and His Holiness the Dalai Lama are just some of the many leading   figures that¬†have been¬†associated with various courses in this exciting   school.</p>

	  <p>Our Joint Honours programmes in Theology enable the study of the   major questions of life ‚Äì Where do we come from? Why are we here? Where   are we going? Why do bad things happen? ‚Äì considered from the   perspective of the Judeo-Christian traditions. These joint degree   schemes are for students who wish to explore the sacred writings of   Judaism and Christianity, as well as the teaching, practices and social   impact of Christianity.</p>
      <p>You will have the opportunity to study these religious traditions   from historical and contemporary perspectives, building on staff   specialism in biblical studies, church history, theology, and religion   in the modern world.</p>
      <p>Our Joint Honours Theology programmes enhance a wide range of   relevant skills and attributes for students when they move into the   world of work. The approach to theology conforms to the academic rigour   of all disciplines that constitute today&rsquo;s HE sector and prepares its   students for a variety of vocations that may include ministerial and   ecclesiastical vocations in a variety of denominations. However, the   programmes are designed to offer a solid programme of study for students   whether from a faith background or from those who have no faith but   wish to explore questions raised by theological study.</p>
      <p>Our Joint Honours Theology programmes generate the &lsquo;well rounded&rsquo;   student that schools, business, civil service, churches and all aspects   of the professional world look for in their graduates.</p>

		<h1>BA Religion and Society</h1>
	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
	  <p>Religion is dynamically related to all aspects of human life. It has   impacted on politics, society and the environment, and through its   historical and contemporary influence, it has shaped the world around   us. Indeed, we cannot truly understand the world, and even ourselves,   without comprehending religions in all their diversity. This course is   designed to help students understand religions in their cultural,   sociological and historical contexts. You will examine the roles that   religions play in the pressing issues of our era. The programme takes   students beyond superficial media coverage of contemporary events into   deeper issues of history, identity, and the implications of religious   commitment for issues of world concern.</p>
      <p>The course covers an extensive array of contemporary, thematic,   historical and geographical areas as well as a wide range of religious   traditions. This gives students a real insight into the human condition   and the multiplicity of religious beliefs and practices in the world.   You will have the opportunity to visit places of worship and other sites   of significance for the study of religion and society, as well as   acquiring practical, first-hand engagement with &lsquo;other&rsquo; cultures and   religions.</p>

		<h1>Religious Studies</h1>
	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
	  <p>This newly launched degree scheme, which is taught on the Carmarthen   campus, offers students a thorough grounding in the beliefs and   practices of a wide range of world faiths. The course is designed to   help students understand the role of religion in the contemporary world   and to give them the opportunity to study the origins, development and   impact of various religious traditions, including Judaism, Christianity,   Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism.</p>
      <p>This BA programme enables students to become familiar with the   specifics of religious traditions and to make comparisons between the   beliefs and practices of different religions, particularly in the   context of a world coming to terms with its cultural and religious   diversity.</p>
      <p>Our new BA degree in Religious Studies is intended to stimulate   curiosity about, and fascination for, the variety of religious cultures   across the globe and to open up a greater awareness of plurality within   religious traditions and within societies at large. This gives students a   real insight into the human condition and the multiplicity of religious   beliefs and practices in the world. Students will have the opportunity   to visit places of worship and other sites of significance for the study   of religion, as well as acquiring practical, first-hand engagement with   &lsquo;other&rsquo; cultures and religions.</p>

		<h1>Film and Visual Culture</h1>
	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
      <p>The BA Film and Visual Culture is an innovative degree programme, which combines the academic study of film and other visual media with the creative production of individual pieces of work in specialised areas. By combining theory and practice, students are encouraged to enhance their understanding of cinema as a medium through the creation of practical work.</p>
      <p>The programme has been conceived with an emphasis upon vocational skills and employability; over the course of their studies, students will assemble a portfolio of work to enable them to compete for employment in their chosen field of the film industry.</p>
      <p>Emphasis has been given to entrepreneurial skills, and to the skills required to publish and exhibit work to audiences beyond the university.</p>
	  <p>Students will be invited to engage with a broad range of contemporary media (such as film, television, graphic novels and comics, internet and mobile publishing, interactive media and gaming), and to focus their major projects upon the areas of their choice.</p>
	  <p>Over the course of the programme, students will be able to combine the theoretical and academic analysis of film and visual media, with practical and creative approaches. Students will have the opportunity to engage in all stages of filmmaking, from conception, through pre-production and production, and on to publication and/or exhibition.</p>
	  <p>Over the course of these processes, students will gain an insight into those areas that they would wish to specialise in. By their final year, students will be able to opt for a major creative project in a production area of their choice; this could take the form of screenwriting, filmmaking, animation or game design, to name some of the options open to students.</p>

		<h1>New Media Production</h1>
	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
	  <p>The BA New Media Production degree is a multidisciplinary programme that equips students with specialist skills and knowledge in content creation for the contemporary media industry.</p>
	  <p>Students will explore a variety of creative production methodologies such as electronic publishing; online filmmaking; blogging and online journalism; animation; and interactive photography as wells as the underlying web technologies that define New Media. With an emphasis on interactive narratives, the programme puts the user at the centre of the action. It is this interactivity and 360-degree vision that makes New Media Production so distinctive and compelling.</p>
	  <p>A hands-on programme, there is also a core theoretical strand, ranging from media theory, academic skills and contemporary issues in the Creative Industries. There is an emphasis on employability skills, with specific opportunities for work placement and business development planning.</p>
	  <p>Teaching is delivered in hands-on workshops, lectures and seminars where students are encouraged to develop their analytical, conceptual and practical thinking. Ideas will be developed through pitches, workshops and presentations, and expressed in the production work and written critical appraisals.</p>
	  <p>As students progress through the programme they will produce increasingly complex work culminating in a final year Creative Project that will be their calling card when they enter the Creative Industries, further develop their expertise in postgraduate programmes or start their own business.</p>

	              <p><strong>Course Code: </strong>W130</p>
	              <p>This degree has evolved from the successful and well established sculpture course based in Carmarthen for over 40 years.</p>
	              <p>The   course is unique within the UK in that it offers a first year solely   based on practical studies. Indeed, we seem to be the only specialist   sculpture course in the country that still stresses the importance of   object making and associated craft skills. We can achieve this by   keeping our enrolment low so that individual students can benefit from   individual tuition in well-equipped workshops. Although the first year   is devoted to the exploration of traditional materials and techniques,   3rd year sculpture student degree shows regularly include photography,   film and installation. We believe that sculpture is a diverse and   dynamic art form.</p>
	              <p>First year students work in all the main areas   of traditional sculpture; modelling, moulding, steel construction, stone   and wood carving as well as bronze casting in our purpose built foundry   designed by Ab Abercrombie director of AB Fine Art (London), and iron   casting using student-built furnaces. The sculpture department is the   only UK sculpture course to offer casting in sand, ceramic shell and   Italian block as well as the iron casting facility. Second and third   year students are expected to develop their own voice within the   contemporary fine art field and are encouraged to visit major   exhibitions either individually or on educational visits such as to the   Venice Biennale .</p>
	              <p>The module structure is intended to provide   opportunities to develop making skills, whilst also being conscious of   the broader dialogue happening within contemporary sculpture,   particularly the current debate on materials.</p>
	              <p>Teaching and   learning strategies are intended to progressively challenge the students   perception and engage them in current debates within traditional and   contemporary sculpture, whilst developing personal, professional and   cultural ambitions. Students can expect variety and a well-paced,   holistic yet specific programme of assignments that will foster and   nurture practical skills and academic/critical rigour.</p>
	              <p>Academic   and technical staff are well qualified and committed. Tutors have a   strong personal and professional commitment to the medium of sculpture   and this is demonstrated through research plus national and   international exhibition track records.</p>
	              <p>All students are screened for learning difficulties and any identified are helped by our dedicated learning support team.</p>

	  <p>Coleg Sir Gar - Carmarthenshire College has an established reputation for facilitating the creative development of art and design students. This new course has evolved in response to contemporary art and design practice, culture and industry and is available bilingually, where students can choose to be taught and supported through the medium of Welsh or English. </p>
	  <p>On this course, students will be encouraged to explore traditional and digital illustrative techniques. Students will be working in 2D, 2.5D and 3D environments using speColeg Sir Gart software to develop the ability to combine 2D painting techniques with 3D sculpting and create illustrations that blend the two. This will enable students to expand the barriers of experimentation and creativity. Experimentation is seen as paramount in achieving this, and a keen interest in the visual world should inform this experimentation. There is a strong emphasis on drawing as a means of exploring the visual environment. Aimed at students with a keen interest in drawing and an interest in digital imaging, this course focuses on understanding and developing visual language and refining technique. </p>
	  <p>Through experimentation, exploration and continual practice you are encouraged to develop your individual style, methods and language as diverse as your imagination. Areas covered would include life drawing, concept art development, 2D, 2.5D and 3-D illustration, including modelling, texturing, lighting and rendering. Alongside the core practical skills, students also learn enriching conceptual and theoretical topics such as art, design and communication.</p>
	  <p>You will develop a speColeg Sir Gart range of skills and be challenged by industry level assignments and internationally set competition briefs. To use illustration in a wide range of media such as video games, films, animation, advertising and publishing. There is a growing demand for digital artists/illustrator and graphic designers who have exposure to both 3D design and digital illustration. Graduates from this course should certainly have the right skills to help meet that demand. </p>
	  <p>The programme can also offer individuals an opportunity to create work in a bilingual context and environment. Your practice is supported by an integrated theory programme enabling students to work confidently and professionally within the context of 2D and 3D Illustration. </p>

	  <p>Coleg Sir G√¢r - Carmarthenshire College has an established reputation for facilitating the creative development of art and design students. This new course has evolved in response to contemporary art and design practice, culture and industry. This is a broad course encompassing the fact that photography spans both professional design and fine art practice. The course encourages creativity and develops your photographic, visual and technical skills based on your interests. It will introduce you to the diversity of photographic and creative techniques (digital and silver-based) used for commercial and personal practice. </p>
	  <p>Throughout the course, students will develop a personal strategy for developing a career through photography. Students will be given opportunities to explore areas such as digital photography that recognises the new digital literacy in visual language for the professional photographer. Learners will use cameras as capture devices for studio and location imaging for editorial, fashion and advertising clients and develop creative image, editing skills, whilst also learning retouching and digital delivery. Additionally the Welsh landscape will reflect the cultural values of traditional and contemporary imaging in Wales. This will encourage and enable you to look at the Welsh landscape as a site of change from the social, historical, industrial and the beautiful.</p>
	  <p> Your practice is supported by an integrated theory programme enabling you to work confidently and professionally within the context of photography. </p>

	</div>
  <div data-role="content">
    <p>The University of Wales Trinity Saint David has on the Carmarthen campus over a 160 years experience of offering physical education, sport and outdoor related courses. More recently, these have expanded to include degrees in health, exercise and nutrition, as well as sports thearpy.

Vocational relevance is a strong theme underpinning all degrees and students are strongly encouraged to gain additional experience and qualifications to <img src="http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/media/uniweb/content/images/departments/facultyartsandsocialstudies/Kayak_surf.jpg" alt="Kayak" title="Kayak" align="left">support their career aspirations. Work placement begins in the very first term and is developed further in the second year.

The multidisciplinary approach to Outdoor Education draws upon education, leadership and environmental theory to explore the potential of the natural environment to offer an alternative, experientially focused approach to learning.

Outdoor Education has much to offer as an active, inclusive and natural form of learning that develops positive relationships between the individual, group and environment.

Increasing job opportunities are available in education, recreation, community development, adventure tourism and environmental sustainability. It is recognised as a valuable method of developing the transferable skills relevant to all sectors of the workplace in the twenty-first century.</p>

      <p>The key facts are that most students pay nothing up front and won&rsquo;t   have to pay it back until¬†they earn over ¬£21,000 a year as a graduate.   If you are eligible for UK student support, you will repay a smaller   amount per year than in the current system and you will repay the same   amount no matter what the tuition fee is.</p>
      <p>The payment will automatically come out of your salary if you are   working in the UK after you finish your course, just like tax and   national insurance.</p>
      <h2>How much will my course cost?</h2>
      <p>The cost of your course depends on a number of things ‚Äì mainly what   course you choose and where you are living when you apply for the   course.</p>
      <p>Although the fees at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David have been set at ¬£7,500 for our undergraduate courses, <strong>we   have a range of scholarships and means tested bursaries available   including ¬£1000 towards the cost of University accommodation in your   first year if you are a full fee-paying student.</strong></p>
      <p>If you live in Wales, you will pay ¬£3,465 per year for a full-time   course (which is covered by a fee loan)¬†because the Welsh Government   provides¬†a¬†fee grant to help pay the cost of the ¬£7,500 fee¬†each year.   And there are lots of scholarships and bursaries available from the   University to support talented students from all backgrounds.</p>
